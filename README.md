# 🌐 Language Translator App

This repository showcases a powerful language translation application developed using **React** and **Redux Toolkit**. The project allows users to translate between more than 100 languages with optimized API handling and a clean, responsive interface.

The input selectors in the app are designed with smart filtering functionality, allowing users to easily search and select the desired language by simply typing its name. Additionally, the project features **automatic language detection**—if the user doesn’t manually select a source language, the application automatically detects it and proceeds with the translation based on the selected target language.
